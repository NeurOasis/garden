# G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer

**G**raph **A**ccess and **R**etrieval with **D**eveloper-friendly **E**xploration **N**avigation

## Welcome to Your Data Garden! üå±

This project provides an accessible, lightweight web interface for exploring Neo4j graph databases with minimal coding. Built specifically for public servants who want to develop valuable technical skills while continuing their important work, G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is your clear runway to data exploration and analysis.

### What is G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer?

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is a single-file Flask application that lets you navigate and explore your graph database through simple web pages. No complex UI frameworks, no dependencies on external APIs - just a straightforward tool that helps you see and understand your data.

## The Module Generator: Your Productivity Accelerator üöÄ

At the heart of G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is the **Module Generator**. This tool analyzes your Neo4j database and automatically creates a Python module (middleware) that gives you type-safe, convenient access to your data.

### The Critical Distinction: Module Generator vs. Middleware

It's important to understand the difference between two key components:

- **Module Generator**: The tool that examines your database and creates custom code (you run this once)
- **Generated Middleware**: The custom Python module created by the Module Generator (you use this every day)

This distinction is crucial because the middleware contains only schema information, not actual data, ensuring your sensitive information remains protected.

## "Grasshopper" and "Grassroots": Clear Pathways Through Your Data ü¶óüåø

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer implements two complementary patterns for navigating your graph data:

### The "Grasshopper" Pattern: Node-to-Node Navigation

The Grasshopper pattern lets you "hop" from node to node through your graph by following relationships. Starting at any node, you can see all connections and hop to any connected node with a single click.

### The "Grassroots" Pattern: Schema-Based Entry Points

While Grasshopper is great for exploration, you often need a starting point. That's where the Grassroots pattern comes in, providing structured entry points based on your data schema.

Together, these patterns create a complete exploration experience.

## Getting Started: Your Path to Success üåü

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or newer
- Neo4j database (version 3.5 or newer)
- Neo4j Python driver (`pip install neo4j`)
- Flask (`pip install flask`)

### Quick Start (15 minutes)

1. **Generate your middleware** using the Module Generator:
   ```bash
   python modulegenerator-claude.py -u "bolt://localhost:7687" -n "neo4j" -p "your_password" -g "graph_middleware"
   ```

2. **Place the generated module** in the same directory as `garden_explorer.py`.

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python garden_explorer.py
   ```

4. **Access the login page directly**:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/login
   ```

5. **Log in with the default credentials**:
   - Username: `demo`
   - Password: `demo123`

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Issues (403 Error)
If you receive a "403 Forbidden" error, directly access the login page at `/login` instead of the root URL.

### Middleware Type Errors
If you encounter "Parameters of type X are not supported" errors, check that:

1. Your middleware module is correctly generated and accessible
2. The function calling patterns match what the middleware expects
3. You're not accidentally passing class objects instead of their methods' return values

A common fix for type errors is to modify function calls to avoid direct interaction with Neo4j driver internals:

```python
# Before (might cause type errors)
len(getattr(gm.nodes, label_name)())

# After (safer approach)
# Use a try/except block and a safe fallback value
```

### Missing Middleware
If the application can't find your middleware module:

1. Make sure it's in the same directory as `garden_explorer.py`
2. Check that it's named correctly (the same name you specified with the `-g` flag)
3. For testing, you can create a simplified mock middleware (see examples in the documentation)

## Learning Path: Realistic Timeline üìö

For a motivated learner with basic programming knowledge:

**First Weekend (2-4 hours)**
- Set up your environment
- Generate middleware
- Run the application
- Explore basic features

**First Week (1 hour/day)**
- Study the code structure
- Understand routes and templates
- Learn authentication patterns

**Second Weekend (4-6 hours)**
- Examine middleware integration
- Explore helper functions
- Make minor customizations

**Weeks 2-4 (1-2 hours/day)**
- Modify templates for your needs
- Add custom features
- Implement specialized views

Remember: Each small step adds value immediately! Don't be discouraged by bugs or errors - they're part of the learning process and each one you solve builds your skills.

## Why This Approach Works for Public Servants üèõÔ∏è

This approach:
1. Keeps sensitive data secure within your environment
2. Builds transferable technical skills
3. Delivers immediate practical value
4. Supports iterative learning

## Security and Compliance Considerations üîí

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is designed with government requirements in mind:
- Single-file design minimizes attack surface
- Middleware buffer separates AI tools from sensitive data
- Comprehensive logging tracks all user activity
- Authentication framework allows for future enhancements
- Simple, focused functionality reduces potential vulnerabilities
