# IMPORTANT: Understanding Puzzle Logic

## ðŸš¨ Critical Insight About Test Data

**The test data is FAKE** - I created it to demonstrate the interface, but you caught an important logical error:

### Why FUTURE Might Be WRONG:
- If FUTURE appears many times in real YouTube comments â†’ People have tried it and FAILED
- If it was the right answer â†’ The puzzle would be solved and video taken down
- High guess count = HIGH FAILURE RATE

### The Correct Logic:
1. **Words NOT in comments** might be more likely to be correct
2. **Words tried many times** are probably WRONG
3. **Recent/unique suggestions** might be worth trying

### What This Means:
- We need REAL YouTube comment data to make informed guesses
- The scraper will show which words have ALREADY FAILED
- FUTURE might still be worth ONE try, but if others tried it, it's probably wrong

## ðŸŽ¯ Revised Strategy:

1. **Set up real YouTube API scraping first**
2. **Look for words that HAVEN'T been tried**
3. **Analyze the visual pattern more carefully**
4. **Consider less obvious F-words that fit the "is" pattern**

## ðŸ“Š Better Candidates Might Be:
- Words that complete uncommon phrases
- Words related to NINYE's content style
- Words that haven't appeared in comments yet
- Philosophical or motivational terms

The interface is ready, but we need REAL data to solve this properly!
