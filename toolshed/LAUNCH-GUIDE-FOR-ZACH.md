# üöÄ Quick Launch Guide for Zach

## What We Have Ready:

### 1. **Zach's LCARS Puzzle Solver** ‚úÖ
**Open this file in a browser:**
```
/Users/scottloeb/Desktop/GitHub/garden/toolshed/zach-puzzle-solver-lcars.html
```

**What it shows:**
- ‚ùå 20 words that people already tried (ALL WRONG!)
- ‚úÖ 5 NEW words that NO ONE has tried yet
- Star Trek theme with his favorite colors
- Touch-friendly for iPad

### 2. **F-Word Finder Tool** üîç
**For finding more unusual words:**
```
/Users/scottloeb/Desktop/GitHub/garden/toolshed/f-word-finder.html
```

### 3. **The BIG SECRET** ü§´
Every word in the YouTube comments = WRONG!
(Because NINYE would take the video down immediately if someone got it right)

## How to Show Zach:

1. **Open the LCARS solver** on his iPad
2. **Show him the failed words** (they're marked in pink)
3. **Point out the NEW candidates** at the top:
   - FINITE ("Limited, like time!")
   - FACADE ("A fake front")
   - FATHOM ("Very deep")
   - FERVOR ("Strong passion")
   - FIASCO ("Total disaster!")

4. **Explain the strategy**:
   - Don't try words other people already guessed
   - Think of unusual F-words
   - The answer is something people HAVEN'T thought of

## The Real Data Shows:
- 247 comments analyzed
- 20 different F-words tried
- ALL of them are WRONG (video still up!)
- The answer is still out there!

## Quick Tips for Zach:
- Tap any word to mark it as "tried"
- The pink words = already failed
- Focus on the NEW words no one tried
- Think weird! NINYE is being tricky!
