# 🕵️ Zach's Detective Guide - THE BIG SECRET!

## 🚨 THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:

**If someone typed a word in the comments = IT'S WRONG!** ❌

Why? Because NINYE is watching! As soon as someone gets it right, the video disappears! 
Since the video is still there, that means NO ONE has guessed it yet!

## 🎯 Your Mission:

### Step 1: Watch the Videos Like a Detective 🔍
1. **Count the blanks** - Is it really 6 letters? Or maybe 7?
2. **Listen to NINYE** - Does he emphasize any hints?
3. **Look at everything** - Background, his shirt, anything!

### Step 2: Use Your Tools 🛠️
1. **Open the Puzzle Solver** on your iPad
2. **Scrape the comments** to see what people tried
3. **CROSS OFF every word people guessed** - They're all WRONG!

### Step 3: Think Different! 🧠
The answer is probably:
- A word people DON'T usually think of
- Something that makes sense with "is"
- Maybe related to NINYE's videos or style

## 💡 Smart Ideas:

Instead of common words like FUTURE or FAMILY, try thinking of:
- **Unusual words**: FACADE, FATHOM, FINITE
- **Science words**: FUSION, FUNGUS, FOSSIL  
- **Old words**: FEALTY, FALLOW
- **Tricky words**: FIASCO, FICKLE, FERVOR

## 🎮 How to Win:

1. **Make a list** of F-words people HAVEN'T tried
2. **Pick ones that sound good** with "is" after them
3. **Try the weird ones first** - NINYE is being tricky!

## 📱 Remember:
- Tap words you've tried (they turn pink)
- Long-press to mark favorites (they glow blue)
- The video being up = you still have a chance!

**YOU CAN DO THIS! Be the first to solve it!** 🏆
