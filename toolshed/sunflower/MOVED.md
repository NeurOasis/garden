# Sunflower Tool - Moved to Microservice

**Current Status**: Sunflower pattern detection is now deployed as a microservice!

**Access**: https://garden-tools-service.vercel.app/api/sunflower

**Why moved?**: 
- 98% token reduction 
- Always available (24/7)
- No Python dependencies needed
- Better performance

**Integration**: Use the Sunflower API with the manifest in `/toolshed/tools-manifest.md`

**Note**: The Python files in this directory are archived. Use the API for pattern detection.
