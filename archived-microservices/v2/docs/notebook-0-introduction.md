Whether you're new to graph databases or a seasoned professional, this tool provides a clear path to understanding your data.

This notebook serves as an introduction to G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer, explaining its philosophy, architecture, and how to get started.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:
1. Understand the G.A.R.D.E.N. philosophy and approach to graph exploration
2. Identify the key components of the G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer architecture
3. Recognize the distinction between the Module Generator and the generated middleware
4. Understand the "Grasshopper" and "Grassroots" exploration patterns
5. Set up a basic G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer instance

## 1. The G.A.R.D.E.N. Philosophy

The G.A.R.D.E.N. approach is built on several key principles:

### 1.1 Accessibility

Graph databases are powerful tools for working with connected data, but they can be intimidating for newcomers. G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer aims to make graph data accessible to users of all technical backgrounds through an intuitive, web-based interface.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - A clear, simple route that requires no knowledge of graph databases
@app.route('/')
@login_required
def index():
    """
    Main dashboard that serves as the entry point for both Grassroots and Grasshopper approaches.
    """
    log_activity('view_dashboard')
    
    # Get the schema information for the Grassroots approach
    node_labels = middleware.get_node_labels()
    
    # For the Grasshopper approach, we'll prepare curated entry points
    # These are examples from the movie graph
    featured_movies = []
    featured_people = []
    
    try:
        # Get some featured movies
        movies = middleware.get_nodes_by_label('Movie')
        if movies:
            featured_movies = movies[:5]  # First 5 movies
        
        # Get some featured people
        people = middleware.get_nodes_by_label('Person')
        if people:
            featured_people = people[:5]  # First 5 people
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f"Error loading featured content: {str(e)}", "error")
    
    return render_template(
        'dashboard.html',
        node_labels=node_labels,
        featured_movies=featured_movies,
        featured_people=featured_people,
        get_node_display_name=get_node_display_name
    )
```

This code demonstrates how G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer creates an accessible entry point by:
- Providing a dashboard with starting points for exploration
- Abstracting away the complexity of database queries
- Handling errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Using familiar web interfaces rather than specialized tools

### 1.2 Progressive Learning

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is designed to support progressive learning, allowing users to start with simple exploration and gradually develop a deeper understanding of their data and graph concepts.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Routes that support both basic and advanced exploration
@app.route('/schema')
@login_required
def schema_overview():
    """
    Provide an overview of the database schema (Grassroots entry point).
    Shows all node labels and relationship types.
    """
    log_activity('view_schema')
    
    node_labels = middleware.get_node_labels()
    relationship_types = middleware.get_relationship_types()
    
    # Count instances of each label
    label_counts = {}
    for label in node_labels:
        try:
            nodes = middleware.get_nodes_by_label(label)
            label_counts[label] = len(nodes)
        except Exception:
            label_counts[label] = "Error"
    
    return render_template(
        'schema.html',
        node_labels=node_labels,
        relationship_types=relationship_types,
        label_counts=label_counts
    )
```

This approach allows users to:
- Start with a high-level overview of their data structure
- Explore specific entity types as they become comfortable
- Gradually learn the relationships and connections in their data
- Move from structured navigation to more free-form exploration

### 1.3 Middleware Abstraction

A key principle of G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is the use of middleware to abstract away the complexities of the graph database, making it easier for users to interact with their data without needing to write Cypher queries.

```python
# From middleware_adapter.py - Abstracting database operations behind a clean interface
class MiddlewareAdapter:
    """
    Adapter for Neo4j middleware that provides a consistent interface
    regardless of the specific middleware implementation.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, middleware):
        """
        Initialize the adapter with the middleware module.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        middleware:
            The imported middleware module
        """
        self.middleware = middleware
    
    def get_node_labels(self):
        """
        Get all node labels from the database.
        
        Returns
        -------
        List[str]:
            List of node labels
        """
        if hasattr(self.middleware, 'METADATA'):
            return self.middleware.METADATA.get('node_labels', [])
        return []
```

This code shows how:
- Complex database operations are wrapped in simple, intuitive methods
- Users can access data without knowledge of the underlying query language
- A consistent interface is maintained regardless of database structure
- Error handling and fallbacks are built in to enhance reliability

## 2. Key Components of G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer consists of several key components working together to provide a seamless exploration experience.

### 2.1 Flask Web Application

At its core, G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer is a web application built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. This provides the user interface and handling of HTTP requests.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Flask application setup
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'dev_key_for_testing')
app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = 3600  # 1 hour
```

The Flask application:
- Serves HTML pages to users
- Processes form submissions and requests
- Manages user sessions and authentication
- Renders templates with dynamic data

### 2.2 Module Generator

The Module Generator is a separate tool that analyzes your Neo4j database and generates a Python module (middleware) specifically tailored to your data model.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Importing the generated middleware
try:
    # Import the middleware - normally this would be generated with the Module Generator
    import newgraph as graph_db
    
    # Create a middleware adapter to handle different middleware structures
    from middleware_adapter import create_middleware_adapter
    middleware = create_middleware_adapter(graph_db)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing middleware: {e}")
    # For demonstration purposes, we'll use a simplified mock if the real middleware isn't available
    from helpers import create_mock_middleware
    graph_db = create_mock_middleware()
    middleware = graph_db  # Mock middleware already has the right structure
```

The Module Generator:
- Examines your Neo4j database schema
- Creates a Python module with type-safe interfaces
- Provides a clean API for accessing your specific data model
- Includes comprehensive metadata about your graph structure

### 2.3 Middleware Adapter

The Middleware Adapter sits between the Flask application and the generated middleware, providing a consistent interface regardless of the specific middleware implementation.

```python
# From middleware_adapter.py - Creating a consistent interface
def create_middleware_adapter(middleware):
    """
    Create a middleware adapter for the specified middleware module.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    middleware:
        The imported middleware module
        
    Returns
    -------
    MiddlewareAdapter:
        An adapter that provides a consistent interface to the middleware
    """
    return MiddlewareAdapter(middleware)
```

The Middleware Adapter:
- Abstracts away differences in middleware implementations
- Provides fallback mechanisms for missing functionality
- Standardizes error handling and data formatting
- Simplifies the integration of the middleware with the web application

### 2.4 Helper Functions

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer includes a collection of helper functions that streamline common operations and enhance the user experience.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Helper function for displaying node names
def get_node_display_name(node):
    """
    Gets a human-readable display name for a node based on common properties.
    This helps create more user-friendly links and titles.
    """
    props = node['props']
    
    # Try common name properties in order of preference
    for prop in ['title', 'name', 'fullName', 'displayName']:
        if prop in props and props[prop]:
            return props[prop]
    
    # Fall back to UUID if no name property is found
    return f"Node {node['uuid'][:8]}..."
```

These helper functions:
- Format data for display
- Provide fallbacks for missing information
- Enhance the user interface with intuitive displays
- Handle edge cases and exceptions

## 3. Module Generator vs. Middleware: A Critical Distinction

It's important to understand the distinction between the Module Generator and the middleware it produces.

### 3.1 The Module Generator

The Module Generator is a tool you run once to analyze your database and create custom code.

```python
# From modulegenerator-claude.py - Main function of the Module Generator
def generate_module(uri=None, username=None, password=None, graph=None, output_directory=os.environ['PWD']):
    """
    Assembler function collects strings containing valid Python code
    into a list, then writes the list to a new python module (a file
    ending in .py) in a single write operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uri: str
        A connection string for the neo4j instance.
    username: str
        The user name for the neo4j account. This account needs read access.
    password: str
        The password for the neo4j account.
    graph: str
        The name of the graph for the generated module, e.g. name="demo" 
        results in demograph.py.
    output_directory: str
        The directory to write the generated module to.

    Returns
    -------
    str:
        The filepath to the generated module.
    """
```

The Module Generator:
- Connects to your Neo4j database
- Analyzes the schema (labels, relationships, properties)
- Generates a Python module tailored to your specific schema
- Contains no actual data, only metadata and code

### 3.2 The Generated Middleware

The middleware is the Python module created by the Module Generator, which you'll use in your G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer application.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Using the generated middleware
# Import the middleware - normally this would be generated with the Module Generator
import newgraph as graph_db
    
# Create a middleware adapter to handle different middleware structures
from middleware_adapter import create_middleware_adapter
middleware = create_middleware_adapter(graph_db)
```

The generated middleware:
- Contains metadata about your database schema
- Provides typed functions for accessing your data
- Abstracts away Cypher queries behind a Python API
- Is specific to your database structure
- Contains no actual data, only code to access it

## 4. Exploration Patterns: Grasshopper and Grassroots

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer implements two complementary patterns for navigating your graph data.

### 4.1 The Grassroots Pattern: Schema-First Navigation

The Grassroots pattern starts with the database schema and drills down to specific instances.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Implementing the Grassroots pattern
@app.route('/labels/<label>')
@login_required
def list_nodes(label):
    """
    List all nodes with a specific label (Grassroots navigation).
    """
    log_activity('list_nodes', {'label': label})
    
    try:
        nodes = middleware.get_nodes_by_label(label)
        
        # Get properties for display
        if nodes:
            # Use the first node to determine which properties to show
            display_properties = list(nodes[0]['props'].keys())[:5]  # First 5 properties
        else:
            display_properties = []
        
        return render_template(
            'nodes_list.html',
            label=label,
            nodes=nodes,
            display_properties=display_properties,
            get_node_display_name=get_node_display_name,
            format_property_value=format_property_value
        )
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f"Error listing nodes: {str(e)}", "error")
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
```

The Grassroots pattern:
- Starts by examining the structure of your data
- Lists all available node types (labels)
- Allows drilling down into specific node types
- Shows instances of each type

### 4.2 The Grasshopper Pattern: Entity-First Navigation

The Grasshopper pattern starts with specific entities and "hops" between connected entities.

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Implementing the Grasshopper pattern
@app.route('/nodes/<label>/<node_id>')
@login_required
def view_node(label, node_id):
    """
    View details of a specific node and its relationships (Grasshopper navigation).
    This is the heart of the "hopping" navigation pattern.
    """
    log_activity('view_node', {'label': label, 'node_id': node_id})
    
    try:
        # Find the specific node by ID
        node = middleware.get_node_by_id(label, node_id)
        
        if not node:
            flash(f"Node not found: {node_id}", "error")
            return redirect(url_for('index'))
        
        # Find all relationships connected to this node
        incoming_relationships = middleware.get_incoming_relationships(node_id)
        outgoing_relationships = middleware.get_outgoing_relationships(node_id)
        
        return render_template(
            'node_detail.html',
            node=node,
            label=label,
            incoming_relationships=incoming_relationships,
            outgoing_relationships=outgoing_relationships,
            get_node_display_name=get_node_display_name,
            format_property_value=format_property_value
        )
    
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f"Error viewing node: {str(e)}", "error")
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
```

The Grasshopper pattern:
- Focuses on a specific entity and its connections
- Shows both incoming and outgoing relationships
- Allows "hopping" to connected entities
- Provides a graph-like navigation experience

### 4.3 Combining the Patterns

G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer combines these patterns to provide a comprehensive exploration experience, as seen in the dashboard implementation:

```python
# From garden_explorer.py - Combining both patterns on the dashboard
@app.route('/')
@login_required
def index():
    """
    Main dashboard that serves as the entry point for both Grassroots and Grasshopper approaches.
    """
    log_activity('view_dashboard')
    
    # Get the schema information for the Grassroots approach
    node_labels = middleware.get_node_labels()
    
    # For the Grasshopper approach, we'll prepare curated entry points
    # These are examples from the movie graph
    featured_movies = []
    featured_people = []
    
    try:
        # Get some featured movies
        movies = middleware.get_nodes_by_label('Movie')
        if movies:
            featured_movies = movies[:5]  # First 5 movies
        
        # Get some featured people
        people = middleware.get_nodes_by_label('Person')
        if people:
            featured_people = people[:5]  # First 5 people
    except Exception as e:
        flash(f"Error loading featured content: {str(e)}", "error")
    
    return render_template(
        'dashboard.html',
        node_labels=node_labels,
        featured_movies=featured_movies,
        featured_people=featured_people,
        get_node_display_name=get_node_display_name
    )
```

This combined approach:
- Provides multiple entry points for different learning styles
- Supports both structured and exploratory navigation
- Gives users flexibility in how they approach their data
- Creates a more complete exploration experience

## 5. Getting Started with G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer

Now that you understand the core concepts, let's walk through the basic steps to get started with G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer.

### 5.1 Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- A Neo4j database (version 3.5 or newer)
- Neo4j Python driver (`pip install neo4j`)
- Flask (`pip install flask`)

### 5.2 Generate the Middleware

First, you'll need to generate the middleware for your specific Neo4j database using the Module Generator:

```bash
python modulegenerator-claude.py -u "bolt://localhost:7687" -n "neo4j" -p "your_password" -g "newgraph"
```

This command:
- Connects to your Neo4j database at the specified URI
- Uses the provided credentials for authentication
- Analyzes your database schema
- Generates a file named `newgraph.py` in the current directory

### 5.3 Set Up G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer

Next, place the generated middleware in the same directory as `garden_explorer.py`:

```
your_project_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ garden_explorer.py
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware_adapter.py
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers.py
â”œâ”€â”€ newgraph.py  # Your generated middleware
â””â”€â”€ templates/   # Directory containing HTML templates
```

Make sure the middleware name in `garden_explorer.py` matches your generated file:

```python
# Update this line if your middleware has a different name
import newgraph as graph_db
```

### 5.4 Run the Application

Now you can run the G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer application:

```bash
python garden_explorer.py
```

This will start the Flask web server, and you should see output similar to:

```
Starting G.A.R.D.E.N. Explorer...
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000
```

### 5.5 Log In and Start Exploring

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/login`.

Use the default login credentials:
- Username: `demo`
- Password: `demo123`

After logging in, you'll see the dashboard with entry points for both Grassroots and Grasshopper exploration patterns. You can:
- View the database schema
- Explore specific node types
- Search for entities
- Navigate between connected entities
