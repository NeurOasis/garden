## üîç Specific Questions for Video Review:

1. **Main Puzzle Video**:
   - Does NINYE emphasize any particular words?
   - Is there any visual besides "F_____ is"?
   - What's the context before/after showing the puzzle?

2. **Other NINYE Videos**:
   - What topics does NINYE usually cover?
   - Are there recurring words/phrases?
   - Previous puzzle patterns?

3. **Social Media Cross-Reference**:
   - Any hints posted after the video?
   - Community reactions/theories?
   - NINYE's responses to guesses?

## üí° Current Hypothesis Refinement:

Based on "F_____ is" format and context:
- Statement puzzles often use universal truths
- Money + time pressure = value/priority theme
- YouTuber context = engagement/community theme

This reinforces FUTURE as top candidate:
- "Future is bright" - optimistic/motivational
- "Future is now" - urgency/action
- "Future is yours" - empowerment

## üéØ Action Items:
1. Verify exact letter count from clearest frame
2. Note any verbal emphasis on hints
3. Check if NINYE has used similar formats before
4. Look for any visual Easter eggs
