## Using the App

### Step 1: Get a Template from Claude

1. During your conversation with Claude, when you're ready for a template, simply type:
   ```
   Please create a context initialization template for [your topic]
   ```

2. Claude will generate a well-formatted template for you

### Step 2: Copy the Template

1. **Select all the text** Claude provided:
   - Tap and hold anywhere in the response
   - Tap "Select All" (or manually drag to select everything)
   
2. **Copy the text**:
   - Tap "Copy" in the popup menu

### Step 3: Save the Template

1. **Open the Template Uploader** app (tap its icon on your home screen)

2. **Paste the content**:
   - Tap the large text field
   - Tap "Paste" in the popup menu

3. **Name your template**:
   - Tap the "Template name" field
   - Type a descriptive name (e.g., "data-analysis-starter" or "python-tutorial")
   - No need to add ".md" - it will be added automatically

4. **Save the template**:
   - Tap the "Save Template" button
   - Wait for the confirmation message

5. **Done!** Your template is now saved to the project repository

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Give clear names** to your templates so you can find them later
- **Wait for the success message** to appear before closing the app
- **No internet?** The app will save your content and try again when you're back online
- **Problems?** Contact your project administrator if you encounter any issues

Remember: The app only needs two things from you - the copied template and a name. Everything else happens automatically!
