# Technical Implementation Details - Extracted from Core GARDEN

## Operational Roadmap Items (Extracted from Future Development Roadmap)

### **Short-Term Objectives (Next Sprint)**
1. **Complete Repository Audit:** Systematic inventory of existing GARDEN structure
2. **Unified Backlog System:** Integration of captured ideas with project planning

## Research and Development Initiatives (Extracted from Core GARDEN)

### **Cross-Device Persistence Architecture**
**Challenge:** Current localStorage limits ideas to single browser/device

**Solution Options Under Evaluation:**

**GitHub Integration Approach:**
- **Pros:** Version control, backup, unified ecosystem
- **Cons:** API rate limits, authentication complexity
- **Implementation:** Save ideas as markdown files in repository
- **Timeline:** Medium-term (requires authentication workflow)

**Cloud Sync Approach:**
- **Pros:** Real-time sync, seamless device switching
- **Cons:** Third-party dependency, potential ongoing costs
- **Implementation:** Firebase/Supabase integration
- **Timeline:** Short-term (well-documented APIs)

**Database Backend Approach:**
- **Pros:** Full control, advanced features possible
- **Cons:** Infrastructure costs, maintenance complexity
- **Implementation:** Custom API with database persistence
- **Timeline:** Long-term (significant development required)

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended):**
- **Phase 1:** Enhanced export/import for manual cross-device sync
- **Phase 2:** Optional cloud sync for real-time collaboration
- **Phase 3:** Advanced features like sharing and analytics

### **Collaboration Framework Development**
**Problem Statement:** Multiple developers need to collaborate on GARDEN projects without technical friction

**Use Cases Identified:**
1. **Cross-User Project Handoffs:** Multi-user project collaboration
2. **Asynchronous Team Development:** Multiple developers on same project
3. **Multi-Stakeholder Input:** Non-technical users providing requirements
4. **Conversation Context Merging:** Ideas from different Claude sessions

**Solution Architecture:**

**Project Sharing URLs:**
- Tokenized access to projects across different user contexts
- Edit permissions without credential sharing
- Context preservation across handoff boundaries

**Artifact Collaboration:**
- Cross-conversation artifact sharing and evolution
- Version history and change attribution
- Merge conflict resolution for collaborative editing

**GitHub Integration Enhancement:**
- Multi-user attribution for commits
- Branch management from conversation contexts
- Pull request creation from collaborative artifacts
