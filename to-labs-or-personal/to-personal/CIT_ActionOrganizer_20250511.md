## 📝 Organization System Overview

### 🗂️ Core Structure
- 📥 **INBOX**: Capture all new thoughts here
- ⚡ **QUICK WINS**: Simple, doable tasks
- 🧩 **NEEDS BREAKING DOWN**: Complex/unclear tasks
- ⏳ **WAITING**: Dependent on others
- 📋 **PROJECT LISTS**: One per broken-down project (with clear outcome)

### 📊 Organization Levels
- 📂 **PROJECT**: Collection of related actions with a clear outcome
- 📃 **ACTION CARD**: Single task that can be completed in one sitting
- ✅ **CHECKLIST**: Step-by-step instructions within an action
- 📌 **NOTES**: Context, details, and reference information

### 🏷️ Task Markers
- ❓ "?" for unclear tasks that need further definition
- 🔷 "big" for complex projects requiring breakdown
- 📍 [Location] or (Person) for context-specific tasks
- 🌡️ Temperature for importance/priority level
- 📅 Due Date for firm deadlines
- 📆 Task Date for scheduled completion time

## 📄 Document & Print Standards

### 📱 Digital Reference
- 💻 Use markdown format for digital reference
- 🔤 Use minimum 16px font size for on-screen reading
- 📊 Include proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- 🧩 Structure content with lists and tables for clarity

### 📇 Physical Reference
- 📏 Use 4x6 index cards (landscape orientation)
- 🎨 Use navy blue for section headings
- 🖋️ Use sans-serif fonts for better readability
- 🔍 Create clear visual hierarchy through formatting
- 🖌️ Maintain at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio for all text
- 📄 Print on white or off-white card stock for durability

## 📋 Current Deliverables

```
