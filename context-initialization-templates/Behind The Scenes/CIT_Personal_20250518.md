## 📝 Current Organization System
- **🗂️ Primary Task Manager**: iOS Reminders app
  - ✅ Created organization system: QuickRef_Actions_Concise_20250510_v1.3
  - 📚 Using Lists: 
    - 📥 Inbox (capture all new thoughts)
    - ⚡ Quick Wins (simple, doable tasks)
    - 🧩 Needs Breaking Down (complex/unclear tasks)
    - ⏳ Waiting (dependent on others)
    - 📋 Project-specific lists (one per broken-down project)
  - 🏷️ Task markers: "?" for unclear tasks, "big" for complex projects
  - 🔄 Focus on capturing first, organizing minimally

## 🎯 Current Goals
- 🔕 Reduce inbound distractions (notifications, emails, reminders)
- 🔄 Consolidate task management into a single system
- 🧠 Develop sustainable organization processes that work with natural thinking style
- 🧩 Create manageable approaches to overwhelming tasks
- ⚡ Find ways to work effectively with fluctuating energy levels
- ⛵ Optimize Apple Watch complications for sailing (accurate data, focused taps, single-handed use)

## 💼 Working Style Preferences
- 💭 Prefers capturing thoughts exactly as they occur
- 👁️ Benefits from minimal organization with clear visual hierarchy
- 😖 Struggles with rigid categorization systems
- 📊 Needs flexibility to accommodate energy fluctuations
- 📑 Values quick-reference guides for consistency
- 🖼️ Strongly prefers visual representations over text-based explanations
- 🧮 Appreciates simple, clean visuals that don't require constant refinement

## ✅ Successful Approaches
- ⏱️ Working in small, 5-minute increments to overcome task initiation barriers
- 🏷️ Using simple markers to indicate task complexity ("?", "big")
- 🏢 Creating dedicated spaces for different types of tasks based on clarity and complexity
- 📥 Focusing on capturing everything rather than organizing perfectly
- 🔍 Using cognitive frameworks (Grassroots, Grasshopper, Sunflower) to ensure MECE coverage

## 📊 Preferred Visual Formats
- 🌲 Tree diagrams for hierarchical information (Grassroots approach)
```
Category
├── Subcategory 1
└── Subcategory 2
```
- 🕸️ Network diagrams for connected concepts (Grasshopper approach)
```
[Concept A] ――→ [Concept B]
     ↑             ↓
     └―――――――――――――┘
```
- 📋 Tables for comparing patterns (Sunflower approach)
```
Pattern 1 | Pattern 2
----------|----------
Example A | Example D
Example B | Example E
Example C | Example F
```

## 📱 Technical Environment
- 📱 iPhone 16 Pro (always running latest iOS non-beta release)
