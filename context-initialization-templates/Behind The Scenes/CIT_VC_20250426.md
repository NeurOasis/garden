# CIT_VC_20250426

## Project Information

```
Project: Version Control (VC)
Current Version: vX.Y
Date: YYYYMMDD (today's date)
Goal: Standardize naming and version control across all projects
```

## File Naming Conventions

### Context Initialization Templates
All Context Initialization Templates (CITs) will follow this naming convention:
- Format: "CIT_ProjectName_YYYYMMDD.md"
- Examples:
  - `CIT_VC_20250426.md`
  - `CIT_SailPlan_20250426.md`
  - `CIT_GARDEN_20250410.md`

CITs should not include version numbers as they represent the current state of context as of a specific date.

### Project Files (Version-Controlled Documents)
All project files will follow this naming convention:
- Format: "ProjectName_Description with spaces_vX.Y_YYYYMMDD.md"
- Examples:
  - `SailPlan_Project Guide_v1.0_20250426.md`
  - `GARDEN_Technical Specification_v1.2_20250405.md`
  - `Amish_Implementation Plan_v2.0_20250415.md`

Version numbering:
- X.0 (like v1.0, v2.0): Complete releases or major revisions
- X.Y (like v1.1, v1.2): Interim updates or minor revisions

### Non-Project Files (General Documents)
All general documents will follow this naming convention:
- Format: "YYYYMMDD_Description with spaces.md"
- Examples:
  - `20250426_Meeting Notes.md`
  - `20250405_Quick Reference Guide.md`
  - `20250410_Project Ideas.md`

### Source-Based Documents
For documents from external sources:
- Format: "YYYYMMDD_Source_DocumentType_Description.md"
- Examples:
  - `20250426_Vendor_Invoice_Project Materials.md`
  - `20250405_Client_Feedback_Initial Prototype.md`
  - `20250410_Partner_Agreement_Phase Two.md`

## File Format Standards

### Default to Markdown
- Use markdown (.md) as the default format for all documentation
- Prefer markdown over .txt for better readability and formatting
- Use proper markdown features (headers, lists, code blocks, tables) to improve document structure
- Only use other formats (docx, xlsx, pdf) when specific features are required that markdown cannot provide

### Markdown Best Practices
- Use headers to create clear document structure (# for title, ## for sections, etc.)
- Use code blocks (```) for code, command examples, and terminal output
- Use tables for structured data comparisons
- Use lists for sequential steps or related items
- Use blockquotes (>) for important notes or callouts
- Include a table of contents for longer documents

## Version Retention Policy
- During work on a major version (e.g., v1.0):
  - Retain all interim versions (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
- After releasing a new major version (e.g., v2.0):
  - Keep the previous major release (v1.0)
  - Delete older interim versions (v0.x series)
  - Begin tracking new interim versions (v2.1, v2.2, etc.)
- After releasing another major version (e.g., v3.0):
  - Keep the previous major release (v2.0)
  - Delete older interim versions (v1.x series)
  - Continue pattern for future versions

This policy balances complete history of recent work, preservation of major milestones, and efficient use of storage space.

## Deliverables Tracking
```
Document Name: [Will follow project naming convention]
Current Status: [Draft/Review/Final]
Next Version Due: [Date]
Change Log:
- v2.1 (20250426): Updated to emphasize markdown as preferred format
- v2.0 (20250426): Updated naming conventions for CITs and project files
- v1.0 (20250401): Initial creation
```

## Collaboration Instructions
- All contributors will follow these naming conventions for all artifacts
- If multiple artifacts are created in one session, they will maintain consistent naming
- Version numbers will increment appropriately across conversations
- Create a new version rather than overwriting existing content
- Context Initialization Templates (CITs) should be updated with new dates rather than versions
- Always use markdown for documentation unless specific features require another format

## Example Applied to SailPlan Project
```
CIT File: CIT_SailPlan_20250426.md
Project File: SailPlan_Shortcut Builder_v2.2_20250426.md
Purpose: Provide step-by-step instructions for iOS Shortcuts automation
Next Steps: 
1. Test implementation on various email types
2. Update with additional automation patterns as needed
3. Document any issues encountered during implementation
```
