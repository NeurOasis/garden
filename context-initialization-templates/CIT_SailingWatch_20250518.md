## ⛵ Project Overview

```
Project: Sailing Watch Complications Optimization
Current Version: v1.0
Date: 20250518
Status: Initial assessment
```

## 📊 Project Description

This project aims to optimize Apple Watch complications for sailing, focusing on providing accurate, relevant data with appropriate visualization that accounts for watch orientation while sailing. The goal is to consolidate apps where possible to reduce subscription costs while maintaining or improving functionality.

## 🧰 Current Setup

### Watch Configuration
- Device: Latest Apple Watch (non-Ultra)
- Watch Face: Infographic Pro

### Current Complications
- **Top Left**: Weathergraph - feels like temperature
- **Top Right**: Weathergraph - UV index
- **Bottom Left**: Apple Weather - UV index (duplicate)
- **Bottom Right**: Weathergraph - precipitation (current & next)
- **Sub-Dial Top**: Weathergraph - wind
- **Sub-Dial Left**: TIDES - tide forecast
- **Sub-Dial Right**: World Clock - sunrise/sunset
- **Sub-Dial Bottom**: Windy.app - wind & wave

### App Analysis
- **Weathergraph** ($24.99/year)
  - Provides multiple weather metrics
  - Uses Open-Metro for best-fit model selection
  - High accuracy
  - Issue: Tapping shows last selected metric, not tapped metric

- **TIDES** (free)
  - Native Apple Watch app
  - Shows tide height, rising/falling, next peak/trough
  - Excellent focused interface when tapped
  - Also shows swell data

- **Windy.app** ($84.99/year)
  - Excellent visualizations for wind, gusts, swell
  - Extensive phone app with detailed data and models
  - Issue: Watch complication doesn't update live, shows only app icon

## 🎯 Key Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Live-updating complications
- Orientation-independent heading/bearing (relative to boat trajectory)
- Data that taps through to relevant detailed views
- Integration with Raymarine instruments (future enhancement)

### User Experience Requirements
- Single-handed operation optimization
- Clear visuals that work in bright sunlight
- Minimal interaction required
- Consistent data presentation regardless of watch orientation

### Vessel Information
- Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 385
- Raymarine instruments
- Currently tracked with Argo Nav

## 🧩 Problem Analysis

### Pain Points
- Multiple app subscriptions ($110/year currently)
- Fragmented data across applications
- Missing critical navigation data (heading/bearing)
- Orientation issues with compass-based data
- Inconsistent update behavior (especially Windy.app)
- Generic views when tapping some complications

### Desired Improvements
- Consolidate apps to reduce subscription costs
- Add orientation-independent navigation data
- Ensure all complications update live
- Focused, relevant detail views when complications tapped
