# Visual Schedule Project for Zach

## Project Overview
We're creating a visual schedule system for an 8-year-old boy with autism named Zach. This system includes:

1. A structured daily schedule template with time blocks and activity options
2. Visual icons for various activities, particularly outdoor activities
3. Multiple variants of certain activities showing different participants (individual, father-son, father-son-dog)
4. Printable pages with all icons organized for easy cutting and implementation

## Components Created So Far

### Daily Schedule Template
- Created a visual schedule with three columns:
  - Time Block column (auto-fit width)
  - Activity column (square cells)
  - Options column (5x wider than Activity column)
- Populated with daily time blocks from morning to evening

### Outdoor Activity Icons (All Completed)
Created SVG icons for:
1. Go for a Walk (3 variants: individual, father-son, father-son-dog)
2. Go for a Hike (3 variants: individual, father-son, father-son-dog) - *showing forest trails rather than mountains*
3. Go to a Park
4. Go Sailing
5. Go to the Farmers Market
6. Ride Scooters
7. Ride Bikes
8. Have a Picnic
9. Go to a Nature Center
10. Go for a Run
11. Play Catch (3 variants: individual, father-son, father-son-dog)
12. Go for a Swim
13. Go to the Beach

### Printable Pages (All Completed)
Created 6 printable HTML pages formatted for Letter-sized paper:
1. Page 1: Walking Variants (3 icons)
2. Page 2: Hiking Variants (3 icons)
3. Page 3: Play Catch Variants (3 icons)
4. Page 4: Outdoor Activities 1 (6 icons)
5. Page 5: Outdoor Activities 2 (4 icons)
6. Page 6: Instructions for printing and using the icons

Each page features:
- Properly sized icons for the visual schedule
- Corner marks for easy cutting
- Dashed borders around each icon
- Clear page numbering and titles
- Consistent formatting and styling

### Special Considerations
- Hiking icons show forest trails rather than mountains (Zach has concerns about heights)
- Icons are designed to be simple, clear, and non-threatening
- The icons can be printed and cut out for use with the visual schedule
- Icons sized to fit the visual schedule template without covering border lines

## Next Steps to Consider
1. Create additional icon categories like:
   - Indoor activities (reading, building blocks, crafts, etc.)
   - Learning activities
   - Self-care/daily routine tasks (brushing teeth, getting dressed, etc.)
   - Social activities (playdate, family visit, etc.)
   - Food/meal options

2. Develop additional support materials:
   - Reward system integration
   - Visual timers or duration indicators
   - Transition cards or signals
   - "All done" or "completed" markers

3. Create personalized variants for specific contexts:
   - School activities
   - Weekend vs. weekday activities
   - Special events or holidays

## Icon Design Guidelines
- Circular background with border
- Simple, clear imagery representing activity
- Limited color palette with good contrast
- Bold text labels
- Consistent style across all icons
- Corner marks for easy cutting

## Technical Specifications
- SVG format for scalability
- Optimized for printing on Letter-size paper
- Simple, autism-friendly design with clear visual hierarchy
- Light gray corner hash marks for cutting guidance

## Instructions for Continuing the Project
To continue developing this visual schedule system, we can:
1. Create new categories of icons
2. Refine existing icons if needed
3. Develop additional templates or support materials
4. Create personalized variants for specific needs
