# Context Initialization Template: GitHub Template Uploader

## Project Status

```
Project: GitHub Template Uploader ("amish country")
Current Version: v1.0
Date: 20250418
Status: Backend implementation complete, frontend connected
Development Environment: macOS, Visual Studio Code, zsh shell
```

## Project Overview

The GitHub Template Uploader is a web application that enables non-technical users to save context initialization templates from Claude conversations directly to a GitHub repository. The solution consists of a responsive web interface and a Node.js backend that handles secure GitHub API integration.

## Completed Implementation

### Backend Components
- Server created using Express.js
- GitHub API integration via Octokit
- Environment variables configured for secure credential management
- Template upload endpoint implemented at `/api/upload-template`
- Static file serving from the `public` directory

### Frontend Components
- Responsive HTML interface optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Copy-paste functionality with clipboard integration
- Error handling and success messaging
- Loading indicators for better user experience

## Current Configuration

### Server Setup
- Project structure established with Node.js and Express
- Dependencies installed: express, @octokit/rest, cors, dotenv
- Environment variables configured in `.env` file
- GitHub repository configured with target branch: `experimental_amish_country`
- Templates saved to folder: `context initialization templates`

### Development Environment
- macOS operating system
- Visual Studio Code for code editing and terminal
- zsh shell (default on macOS)
- Node.js v22.14.0

### Template Format
- All templates saved in Markdown format (.md extension)
- Filenames sanitized and standardized
- Templates stored with descriptive filenames provided by users

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Integration
- Personal Access Token used for repository access
- API requests include proper error handling
- File existence checking to support both new files and updates
- Base64 encoding for content transmission

### User Experience Considerations
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear user feedback during operations
- Simple interface requiring minimal technical knowledge
- Progressive Web App capabilities for installation on home screens

## Next Steps

1. Deploy application to hosting service (options: Vercel, Netlify, or custom server)
2. Create installation guide for end users
3. Implement Progressive Web App features for offline capabilities
4. Set up monitoring for API usage and potential errors
5. Consider implementing authentication if broader access is required

## Testing Plan

- Verify GitHub authentication and permissions
- Test template upload with various content sizes
- Confirm mobile responsiveness on iOS and Android
- Validate error handling for common failure scenarios
- Test network interruption recovery

## Usage Notes

Users can save templates from Claude by:
1. Requesting a context initialization template from Claude
2. Copying the generated template
3. Opening the Template Uploader application
4. Pasting the content and providing a filename
5. Clicking "Save Template" to store it in the GitHub repository

## Technical Reference

```
Backend: Node.js with Express
Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
GitHub API: Octokit/rest client
Data Storage: GitHub repository (Markdown files)
Deployment Target: TBD (Vercel/Netlify recommended)
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, zsh
```

## Implementation Commands (for zsh)

When continuing development, use these commands in Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal:

### Project Setup
```zsh
# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/Documents/GARDEN/amish-country

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install express @octokit/rest cors dotenv
```

### Server Management
```zsh
# Start the server
node new-server.js

# Access the application
# Open browser at http://localhost:3000
```

### File Editing
- Use Visual Studio Code to edit all project files
- Server code: new-server.js
- Frontend code: public/index.html
- Environment configuration: .env

Current implementation exists in repository branch `experimental_amish_country` with server and frontend code working locally on port 3000.
