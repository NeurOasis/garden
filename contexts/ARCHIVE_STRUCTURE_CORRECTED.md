# GARDEN Archive Structure - CORRECTED ✅

## ✅ FIXED: Archive Structure Now Properly Located

### 🏗️ Correct Archive Location
**Repository**: `/neuroasis/garden-archive/` (separate repository)
**Structure**: Mirrors main garden directory structure

```
garden-archive/
├── contexts/
│   ├── behindTheScenes/        # CIT_GARDEN_20250525_ORIGINAL.md ✅
│   ├── internal/               # Ready for future internal archives
│   └── moci/                   # Ready for MOCI archives
├── module-generators/
│   └── modulegenerator_gen1.5_experimental/  # Moved from wrong location ✅
├── tools/                      # Ready for tool archives
├── docs/                       # Ready for doc archives
└── section3-development/       # Existing section 3 files ✅
```

### 🗑️ MANUAL CLEANUP REQUIRED
The following empty directory structure was incorrectly created in main garden and needs to be removed:

**Remove from main garden:**
```
garden/archive/              # DELETE entire directory
├── README.md               # (moved to garden-archive)
├── contexts/               # (empty - delete)
│   ├── behindTheScenes/   # (empty - delete) 
│   ├── internal/          # (empty - delete)
│   └── moci/              # (empty - delete)
├── docs/                   # (empty - delete)
├── module-generators/      # (empty - delete)
└── tools/                  # (empty - delete)
```

### 🎯 Benefits Achieved
1. **Separate Repository**: Archive independent of main garden development
2. **Mirrored Structure**: L0/L1/L2/L3 levels match main garden
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Find archived content where you'd expect it
4. **MECE Compliance**: Single logical location for each archived item

### 📋 Current Archive Content
- **CIT_GARDEN_20250525_ORIGINAL.md** → `garden-archive/contexts/behindTheScenes/`
- **modulegenerator_gen1.5_experimental/** → `garden-archive/module-generators/`
- **Section 3 development files** → `garden-archive/section3-development/` (preserved)

---
*Archive structure corrected - main garden should contain NO archive directory*  
*Manual cleanup required: Delete garden/archive/ directory entirely*
