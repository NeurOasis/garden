# CIT_GARDEN_Fork_Strategy.md

## Document Info
**Current Version:** v1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** June 16, 2025  
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** GARDEN core definition and fork routing strategy

## üèóÔ∏è **WHAT BELONGS IN CORE**

GARDEN core is a **curated collection** of stable, proven components:

- **GARDEN Philosophy & Framework** - Stable documentation of core principles
- **Foundation Technologies** - Proven, stable tools (including NodePad framework)
- **CIT Templates** - Established templates for context management
- **Documentation Systems** - Version history and core CITs

**Note:** No development happens in core. All development happens in labs or personal forks.

## üîÄ **FORK ROUTING LOGIC**

### **Case 1: Personal Project in Labs**
**When:** Core developer begins building personal project in labs  
**Should be:** Personal fork  
**Action:** Move project to personal fork

### **Case 2: Labs Project in Personal Fork**  
**When:** Core developer begins building labs project in personal fork  
**Should be:** Labs  
**Action:** Move project to labs

### **Workflow Cases (Backlog Items)**
- **Case 3:** Contribution workflow (any developer ‚Üí labs ‚Üí core)
- **Case 4:** External developer detection/interaction for beneficial elements

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS PRINCIPLES FOR ANY WORKFLOW**

### **User Experience Standards:**
- **Zero cognitive load:** Users follow exact commands
- **No path confusion:** Full paths provided for every command  
- **Account clarity:** Explicit account switching instructions
- **Error prevention:** Verification steps at each phase

### **Workflow Quality Standards:**
- **Zero Setup Time:** Fork creation to functional project under 2 minutes
- **Complete Functionality:** Generated projects work without additional setup
- **Production Ready:** Single command deploys to live URL with custom domains
- **Collaboration Ready:** Projects shareable across different user contexts

## üéØ **GARDEN PHILOSOPHY VALIDATION**

Any GARDEN workflow should demonstrate:
- **Cognitive Alignment:** Template structures match user mental models
- **Technical Abstraction:** Complex infrastructure hidden behind simple interface
- **Rapid Development:** Infrastructure enables concept to production in single session
- **Progressive Discovery:** Templates can be enhanced without breaking existing functionality
- **Multiple Perspectives:** Different templates support different cognitive approaches

## üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY & CONTEXT PRESERVATION**

Essential principles for any fork/workflow system:
- All development decisions documented in version history
- CITs preserved for both core and fork repositories
- No work lost during fork creation process
- Context handoff process with relevant CITs copied

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK PATTERNS TO AVOID**

- **Repository Bloat:** Automated detection prevents re-accumulation
- **Account Confusion:** Explicit account switching in all instructions
- **Permission Issues:** Organization structure provides clear hierarchy

## üìã **KEY BACKLOG ITEMS**

### **High Priority:**
- **Cross-device persistence architecture** (MAJOR IMPORTANT)
- **Better scope management for collaborative projects**
- Personal project forking workflow
- Labs project forking workflow & branching strategy

### **Strategic Development:**
- Enterprise Collaboration Platform
- GARDEN Ecosystem Integration
- Enhanced Collaboration (cross-user handoffs, project sharing, context preservation)

### **Labs Projects:**
- Personal Context Generator Project
- Collaboration Framework Project
