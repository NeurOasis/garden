## Personal Development Context - Scott Loeb - Updated May 25, 2025

### Core Personal Workflow Preferences

#### **Completion-Driven Development**
**Key Insight:** "I don't like to leave things undone overnight"

**Implications for Project Planning:**
- Prefer complete implementation cycles over partial deployments
- Planning should account for full feature completion in single sessions
- Break larger projects into completable chunks
- End-of-day reviews to ensure proper closure

**Project Management Adaptations:**
- Schedule complex features for start-of-session development
- Maintain clear documentation for handoff between sessions
- Prioritize quick wins and demonstrable progress
- Build in natural stopping points for complex implementations

#### **Rapid Idea Management**
**Pattern Identified:** "Ideas coming at a mile a minute"

**Current Solution:** GARDEN Idea Capture NodePad
- Successfully captured 35+ ideas in first production session
- Cross-device functionality (Mac development, iPhone capture) validated
- Export functionality enabling integration with project planning
- Auto-categorization matching natural thought patterns

**Workflow Integration:**
- Immediate capture prevents idea loss during development sessions
- Regular export to project backlogs maintains organization
- Cross-device access enables capture in any context
- Integration with CIT documentation system for context preservation

### Technical Environment and Preferences

#### **Development Setup**
**Primary Environment:**
- **macOS:** Development and primary coding environment
- **iCloud Documents:** File management and cross-device sync
- **Path:** `/Users/scottloeb/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/github/garden-projects/`
- **GitHub CLI:** Successfully configured for rapid repository management
- **Vercel CLI:** Production deployment workflow established

**Cross-Device Workflow:**
- **Mac:** Primary development, complex feature implementation
- **iPhone:** Idea capture, testing, mobile validation
- **Export/Import Bridging:** Manual sync where real-time unavailable

#### **Tool Preferences**
**Command Line Tools:**
- GitHub CLI for repository management
- Vercel CLI for deployment
- Homebrew for package management (preferred over npm for permissions)

**Development Philosophy:**
- Single-file applications (NodePad 4.0.0 approach)
- No external dependencies where possible
- Progressive enhancement over complex build systems
- Local storage with export capabilities

### UI/UX Aesthetic Preferences

#### **Star Trek/LCARS Inspiration**
**Reference Context:** Dan's "Captain's Log" usage pattern

**Design Elements Appreciated:**
- Curved rectangular blocks with rounded corners
- Modular grid layouts with varied panel sizes
- Distinctive typography (LCARS-style fonts)
- Clean lines and spacers between functional sections
- Status indicators and numerical readouts
- Color-coded sections for different functional areas

**Accessibility Considerations:**
- Understanding of grayscale preferences for color sensitivity
- Appreciation for ADA compliance alongside aesthetic preferences
- Support for multiple UI themes matching different user mental models

#### **Functional Design Philosophy**
**Priorities:**
1. **Functionality First:** Features must work reliably before aesthetic enhancement
2. **User Mental Models:** UI should match how users think about the problem
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start simple, add sophistication gradually
4. **Accessibility Options:** Provide alternatives for different user needs

### Collaboration Patterns and Preferences

#### **Cross-User Project Management**
**Challenge Context:** Working as Scott but needing to update Andrew's projects

**Workflow Friction Identified:**
- Credential switching creates cognitive overhead
- Context loss between different user sessions
- Manual handoff processes slow development velocity
- Need for seamless collaboration without technical barriers

**Ideal Collaboration Patterns:**
- Project sharing URLs with appropriate edit permissions
- Context preservation across different development sessions
- Artifact inheritance and evolution across conversations
- Multi-input synthesis for complex requirements gathering

#### **Asynchronous Development Preferences**
**Strengths in Asynchronous Work:**
- CIT documentation system for context preservation
- Export/import workflows for data continuity
- Clear milestone and completion tracking
- Systematic approach to complex problem solving

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Real-time collaboration when beneficial
- Cross-conversation context bridging
- Multi-stakeholder input synthesis
- Shared project memory systems

### Personal Project Management Philosophy

#### **Systematic Approach to Complex Problems**
**Pattern:** Safe audit before major changes
- Complete inventory before restructuring
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Backup and rollback strategies
- Staged implementation with validation points

**Example:** Repository restructuring approach
1. Complete audit of existing structure
2. Create comprehensive backup
3. Test new structure in separate branch
4. Validate all functionality before migration
5. Document changes for future reference

#### **Value-Driven Development**
**Focus Areas:**
- **Immediate Utility:** Tools must provide value from first use
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Build solid foundation, add sophistication
- **User Empowerment:** Enable users rather than constrain them
- **Accessibility:** Consider diverse user needs and contexts

### Personal Development Goals and Interests

#### **Spoon Theory Research and Application**
**Personal Interest:** Creating accessible explanations of neurodivergent experiences

**Project Vision:** Spoon Theory NodePad
- Visual artifact explaining energy management for neurodivergent individuals
- Research-backed approach to universal applicability

- Distinction between fewer starting spoons vs. higher activity costs
- Evidence-based approach to spoon restoration processes

**Research Requirements:**
- Qualified, unbiased, peer-reviewed sources
- Universal applicability across diverse populations
- Visual orientation with minimal text
- Clear, understandable to general reader

#### **Voice-to-Podcast Development**
**Concept:** "The longest germinating idea ever"

**Vision:** Asynchronous voice collaboration creating podcast-ready content
- Multiple voice inputs recorded separately
- Automatic stitching into coherent audio narrative
- Editing-ready output for podcast production
- Cross-conversation collaboration through audio

#### **Home Integration Projects**
**Context:** Integration with existing home automation
