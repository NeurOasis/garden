## KEY LISTS
- **Inbox**: Capture all new thoughts here
- **Quick Wins**: Simple, doable tasks
- **Needs Breaking Down**: Complex/unclear tasks
- **Waiting**: Dependent on others
- **[Project Name]**: Create for each understood project

## ACTIONS SHORTCUTS
- Add "?" to title = Don't fully understand yet
- Add "big" to title = Complex project
- Add [Location] or (Person) in title for context
- Use Notes field for brain dumps
- Only use Temperature/Deadlines when truly needed

## QUICK DECISION GUIDE
```
New thought → Add as Action in INBOX
Simple task → Move to QUICK WINS
Understand all steps → Create PROJECT LIST
Don't understand steps → Move to NEEDS BREAKING DOWN
Dependent on someone → Move to WAITING
```

## WHEN ENERGY IS...
**LOW**: Do something from Quick Wins
**HIGHER**: Process Inbox or break down one complex item

## REMEMBER
Perfect organization ≠ getting things done
Capture everything, organize minimally
