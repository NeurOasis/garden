  - Using Lists: Inbox, Quick Wins, Needs Breaking Down, Waiting, and Project-specific lists
  - Task markers: "?" for unclear tasks, "big" for complex projects
  - Focus on capturing first, organizing minimally

- **Physical Document System**: Four folders in priority order
  1. Unread: Unopened or unprocessed documents
  2. For Review: Documents needing deeper assessment
  3. For Action: Documents with clear next steps
  4. File/Save: Documents to retain physically

- **Other Digital Systems**:
  - Email: Working toward Inbox Zero (300+ emails backlog)

  - Goal: Consolidate all tasks into Actions App

## Current Goals
- Reduce inbound distractions (notifications, emails, reminders)
- Consolidate task management into a single system
- Develop sustainable organization processes that work with natural thinking style
- Create manageable approaches to overwhelming tasks
- Find ways to work effectively with fluctuating energy levels

## Working Style Preferences
- Prefers capturing thoughts exactly as they occur
- Benefits from minimal organization with clear visual hierarchy
- Struggles with rigid categorization systems
- Needs flexibility to accommodate energy fluctuations
- Values quick-reference guides for consistency

## Successful Approaches
- Working in small, 5-minute increments to overcome task initiation barriers
- Using simple markers to indicate task complexity ("?", "big")
- Creating dedicated spaces for different types of tasks based on clarity and complexity
- Focusing on capturing everything rather than organizing perfectly
