# Master README: Context Initialization Templates (CITs)

## 👋 Welcome to the GARDEN CIT System!

This repository contains a collection of Context Initialization Templates (CITs) designed to help Claude provide more tailored, consistent, and effective assistance. These templates create a shared context between you and Claude about your projects, preferences, and working style.

## 📝 What Are CITs?

Context Initialization Templates (CITs) are structured documents that:
- Create persistent context between conversations with Claude
- Establish consistent standards across multiple projects
- Provide technical specifications, personal preferences, and project details
- Enable Claude to "remember" important information across sessions

Think of CITs as configuration files for your Claude experience, helping deliver more personalized and effective results.

## 🌱 The G.A.R.D.E.N. Philosophy

G.A.R.D.E.N. (Graph Algorithms, Research, Development, Enhancement, and Novelties) embraces these core principles:

1. **Cognitive Alignment**: Design interfaces that match how people naturally think
2. **Technical Abstraction**: Hide complex implementation details behind intuitive interfaces
3. **Rapid Development**: Use automation to accelerate building and deploying tools
4. **Progressive Discovery**: Enable users to start simply and access more advanced capabilities gradually
5. **Multiple Perspectives**: Support different cognitive approaches to exploring the same data

We believe powerful tools should be accessible to everyone, not just technical specialists.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Creating Your Personal CIT

To create your own personal context template:

1. Start a conversation with Claude
2. Ask Claude to "create a personal CIT for me"
3. Answer Claude's questions about:
   - Your preferred working style
   - Technical environment (devices, apps, tools)
   - Communication preferences
   - Special considerations (neurodiversity, accessibility needs, etc.)
4. Save the resulting CIT in your own "Behind The Scenes" folder

### Using CITs Effectively

For the best results with Claude:

1. Include relevant CITs at the start of important conversations
2. Start new conversations when switching between projects
3. Keep project-specific CITs updated as projects evolve
4. Create new CITs for significant new projects

### Document Standards

All materials follow these standards:

- **Digital Documents**: 16px minimum font size, responsive design, semantic structure
- **Quick Reference Cards**: 4x6 index cards (landscape orientation)
- **Standard Documents**: 8.5x11 letter size with 1" margins
- **Accessibility**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio, proper heading hierarchy, screen reader compatibility

## 💡 Key Projects

### GARDEN Graph Database Tools

The GARDEN project includes multiple approaches to graph data:

- **🌱 Grassroots**: Schema-first exploration of graph data
- **🦗 Grasshopper**: Entity-first graph navigation
- **🌻 Sunflower**: Pattern-first relationship discovery

All built on the Module Generator that creates Python interfaces to Neo4j databases.

### Action Organizer System

A minimalist task management approach:

- Captures thoughts exactly as they occur
- Organizes minimally to reduce cognitive load
- Matches tasks to current energy levels
- Uses iOS Reminders with a specific list structure

### SailPlan Automation

Automatically processes sailing reservation emails:

- Creates calendar events for sailing trips
- Handles cancellations and time changes
- Sets reminders for reservation confirmations
- Generates packing lists for different sail types

### Brand Standards System

Establishes consistent design across all projects:

- ADA-compliant color palette
- Typography system for digital and print materials
- Document templates and standards
- Quick reference card format for 4x6 index cards

## 🙋 Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to include all CITs in every conversation?**  
A: No! Only include the most relevant ones. The Personal CIT and project-specific CITs for whatever you're working on.

**Q: How often should I update my CITs?**  
A: Update them whenever significant details change about your projects or preferences.

**Q: What if I want to create a new project CIT?**  
A: Ask Claude to help you create a new CIT for your specific project, following the naming conventions in the Version Control CIT.

**Q: How detailed should my Personal CIT be?**  
A: Include enough detail to help Claude understand your needs and preferences, but you don't need to share anything you're uncomfortable with.

## 📋 Reminders When Working with Claude

- Start new conversations for best performance after 20-30 messages
- Save important outputs as artifacts when appropriate
- Include the most relevant CITs at the start of important conversations
- Ask Claude to create CITs for new projects to maintain consistency

Remember that this system is designed to evolve as your needs change. Feel free to modify templates, create new ones, or ask Claude for help improving the system.
