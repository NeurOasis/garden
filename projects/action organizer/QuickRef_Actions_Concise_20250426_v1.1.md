- Add "big" to title = Complex project
- Add [Location] or (Person) in title for context
- Use Notes field for brain dumps
- **Temperature**: Use to indicate importance (higher = more important)
- **Due Date**: Use for firm deadlines
- **Task Date**: Assign when scheduling task completion from backlog

## WEEKLY WORKFLOW

- Use Temperature and Due Dates to determine priority

## QUICK DECISION GUIDE
```
New thought → Add as Action in INBOX
Simple task → Move to QUICK WINS

## REMEMBER
Perfect organization ≠ getting things done
Capture everything, organize minimally
