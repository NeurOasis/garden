# Action Organizer System

## üëã Welcome!

Welcome to the Action Organizer system! This simple but powerful approach to task management is designed specifically for people who need flexibility, minimal organization, and support for fluctuating energy levels.

## üìù What's This All About?

The Action Organizer is a task management system that:

- **Captures thoughts** exactly as they occur, without filtering
- **Organizes minimally** to reduce cognitive load
- **Matches tasks** to your current energy level
- **Adapts flexibly** to your changing needs
- **Prioritizes doing** over organizing

Think of it as a gentler, more intuitive way to manage tasks that works with your natural thinking patterns rather than forcing rigid systems.

## üóÇÔ∏è What's Included

### Core Reference Files

- **Quick Reference Card**: A concise 4x6 card with all essential information
- **Action Organizer CIT**: Complete system documentation and implementation details
- **PDF Version**: Printable reference card for physical use

### System Components

- **Organization Levels**: Clear definitions of projects, actions, checklists, and notes
- **Lists Structure**: Simple categorization system for different types of tasks
- **Task Markers**: Shortcuts to add context and clarity to tasks
- **Weekly Process**: Streamlined review and prioritization approach

## üìä System at a Glance

### Core Lists
- **INBOX**: Capture all new thoughts here
- **QUICK WINS**: Simple, doable tasks
- **NEEDS BREAKING DOWN**: Complex/unclear tasks
- **WAITING**: Dependent on others
- **PROJECT LISTS**: One per broken-down project

### Task Markers
- **?**: Tasks you don't fully understand yet
- **big**: Complex projects requiring breakdown
- **[Location]** or **(Person)**: Context-specific tasks
- **Temperature**: Importance/priority level
- **Due Date**: Firm deadlines
- **Task Date**: Scheduled completion time

## üìÑ Implementation Guide

### Digital Implementation
The system works best with:
- iOS Reminders app with custom lists
- Task temperature using priority settings
- Notes field for additional context
- Tags for quick filtering

### Physical Implementation
For those who prefer paper:
- Print the Quick Reference Card on 4x6 index cards
- Use sticky notes for capturing thoughts
- Transfer to your digital system later

## üí° Key Principles

1. **Capture First**: Record thoughts exactly as they occur without filtering
2. **Organize Later**: Initial organization happens after capture, not during
3. **Quick Wins**: Focus on simple tasks when energy is low
4. **Break Down**: Process complex items when energy is higher
5. **Flexible Structure**: Adapt organization to changing needs and contexts

## üîÑ Weekly Process

The system relies on a simple weekly review:
1. Review backlog (Inbox/Quick Wins)
2. Assign Task Dates by priority
3. Prioritize by Temperature/Due Dates
4. Move items to appropriate lists

## üë• Who This System Is For

This system works especially well for:
- People who struggle with rigid organization systems
- Those with fluctuating energy levels
- Anyone who prefers capturing thoughts exactly as they occur
- People who value minimal organization and maximum flexibility
- Those who want to reduce cognitive load when managing tasks

## üôã Common Questions

**Q: Is this compatible with GTD or other task systems?**  
A: The Action Organizer borrows concepts from several systems but simplifies them. You can integrate elements of GTD or other systems if they work for you.

**Q: What app should I use for this?**  
A: We designed this primarily for the iOS Reminders app, but it works with any task manager that supports lists, priorities, and notes.

**Q: How does this help with "analysis paralysis"?**  
A: By separating capture from organization and focusing on matching tasks to energy levels, you'll spend less time organizing and more time doing.

**Q: What makes this different from other systems?**  
A: Most systems prioritize rigid organization. This system prioritizes flexibility, minimal organization, and matching tasks to current energy levels.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create the core lists in your task manager
2. Print the Quick Reference Card for easy reference
3. Start by capturing everything in your INBOX
4. Set aside 15 minutes to review and sort items
5. When energy is low, focus on QUICK WINS
6. When energy is higher, process your INBOX
