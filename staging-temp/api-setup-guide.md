# YouTube API Setup Instructions

Since you mentioned you added the API credentials, here's how to use them:

## Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
# Add to your shell configuration
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Then run the scraper
python3 /Users/scottloeb/Desktop/GitHub/garden/toolshed/youtube-api-scraper.py
```

## Option 2: Direct Python Usage
```python
import os
os.environ['YOUTUBE_API_KEY'] = 'your-api-key-here'

# Then import and run the scraper
```

## Option 3: Using the Web Interface
Open: /Users/scottloeb/Desktop/GitHub/garden/toolshed/ninye-puzzle-solver.html

The web interface will use the API if configured on the backend server.
