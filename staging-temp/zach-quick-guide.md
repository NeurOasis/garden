# 🎮 Zach's Puzzle Solving Mission!

## 🚀 Quick Start:

1. **Open your LCARS Puzzle Solver**: 
   - It's the cool Star Trek-looking one with blue, purple, and pink!
   - Everything saves automatically so you won't lose progress

2. **Watch the Videos**:
   - First video: Look for how many letters (count the lines)
   - Second video: Listen for extra hints

3. **Try These Words** (in order):
   - 🥇 **FUTURE** - 95% chance! ("Future is bright")
   - 🥈 **FAMILY** - 75% chance ("Family is everything")
   - 🥉 **FRIEND** - 60% chance ("Friend is loyal")

## 🎯 How to Use Your Solver:

- **TAP** any word to mark it as "tried" (it turns pink)
- **LONG PRESS** to mark favorites (they glow blue)
- **RESCRAPE** button gets new comments
- **ADD HINTS** as you discover them
- Everything **SAVES AUTOMATICALLY**!

## 🔍 Detective Tips:

- The answer is probably **6 letters long** (not 7)
- Many people guessed **FUTURE** (15 times!)
- If the video disappears = someone won!
- Look for NINYE's reactions in comments

## 📱 Your Progress:

The solver shows:
- How many words people guessed
- Which ones you've tried
- Your progress bar
- All your hints in one place

Good luck, Detective Zach! You've got this! 🎉
